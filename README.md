# yiff-remover
recursivly searches the current directory for images and deletes them if they are yiff.

## how it works
it checks if the md5sum exists on e621. simple as that.

## why
i was doing data recovery and for some reason one drive just had thousands and thousands of drawings and i cannot sort through all that shit.
